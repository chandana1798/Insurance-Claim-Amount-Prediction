# Consumer Insurance Claim and Amount Prediction Project
## 1. Project Overview
#### The Insurance Claim Prediction project is designed to predict whether a consumer will file an insurance claim and, if so, the amount of the claim. This project employs machine learning techniques to classify and predict based on a synthetic dataset containing information about consumers, their policies, and previous claims.
### Key features of the project:
#### .Predict whether a claim will be filed (classification).
#### .Predict the amount of the claim if it is filed (regression).
#### .Built using Python, Scikit-learn

## 2. Problem Statement and Objective
#### The objective of this project is to develop two machine learning models:
#### 1.Classification model: Predict whether a customer will file a claim (binary classification: claim or no claim).
#### 2.Regression model: Predict the claim amount for customers who are predicted to file a claim.
#### This project is essential for improving risk management, resource allocation, and customer service in insurance companies.

## 3. Dataset
#### Since the dataset is synthetic, it was created using Python's numpy and pandas libraries. It includes the following features:
#### .Age: Age of the customer.
#### .Gender: Gender of the customer (encoded as 0 for Male, 1 for Female).
#### .Policy_Type: Type of insurance policy (Comprehensive or Third Party).
#### .Number_of_Claims: Number of claims filed by the customer in the past.
#### .Previous_Claim_Amount: The amount of the customer's previous claim.
#### .Claim_Filed: A binary value indicating whether a claim was filed (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
#### .Claim_Amount: The amount of the claim filed (only for customers who filed a claim).

## 4. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
#### Data preprocessing steps include:
#### .Handling missing values: No missing values were present in the synthetic dataset, but in real-world scenarios, we handle them using imputation methods.
#### .Encoding categorical variables: Categorical variables such as Gender and Policy_Type were encoded using label encoding.

## 5. Modeling and Evaluation
### Classification Model:
#### A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict whether a claim would be filed. The model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#### .Accuracy: Measures the overall performance of the model.
#### .Precision: Measures how many of the predicted claims were actually claims.
#### .Recall: Measures how many of the actual claims were identified by the model.
#### .F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
### Regression Model:
#### .A Random Forest Regressor was used to predict the claim amount for customers who filed a claim. The model was evaluated based on:
#### .Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
#### .Mean Squared Error (MSE)
#### .R-Squared (RÂ²): Indicates the model's explanatory power.
#### Both models were fine-tuned using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work
### Conclusion:
#### This project demonstrates the ability to build predictive models for insurance claims using machine learning techniques. By predicting whether a claim will be filed and the amount, the model can be used for better resource allocation and risk management in the insurance industry.
### Future Work:
#### .Improve Data Quality: The project used a synthetic dataset. Real-world datasets with more features and complexities can be explored.
#### .Model Improvements: Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.
#### .Deployment Enhancements: The Flask app can be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible for wider use.
